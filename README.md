WoodDye
==========
No plugin does wood more good! Stain your wood with dyes - bleach it with bone meal!

Simply use bonemeal or light grey dye to lighten wood textures, and brown or black dye to darken them.

Just click on a Wooden Plank, Wooden Stair or Wooden Slab/step with a dye to change its colour.

And now in 2.0 you can use MagmaCream to make wood planks and slabs fireproof!  
Fireproof wood uses the oak texture, it actually changes it to the old stone slab/double slab with wood texture so the blocks remain compatible (and fireproof) if used as vanilla minecraft maps.

Config allows you to choose if using dyes to stain wood consumes them, and if magma cream can be used to fireproof.

Also add recipes for wood dyes.
