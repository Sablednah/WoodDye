WoodDye
==========
No plugin does wood more good! Stain your wood with dyes - bleach it with bone meal!

Simply use bonemeal to lighten wood textures, and brown or black dye to darken them.

Config allows you to choose if using dyes to stain wood consumes them.


Also add recipes for wood dyes.

Any Wood + black Dye = Pine wood.

Any Wood + white Dye = Birch wood.
